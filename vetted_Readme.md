## Introduction & How to Use This Roadmap

This roadmap breaks down 100 days of learning into eight progressive phases:

- **Phases** group related topics together.
- **Daily entries** include mission, why it matters, toolbox, further reading, and challenges.
- You can **fork or copy** each dayâ€™s section into individual README files as you see fit.
- Feel free to **adjust pacing**â€”complete multiple days in one sitting or spread them out.

## Rules & Guidelines

1. **Consistency over intensity.** Better to learn 1 hour/day for 100 days than cram in one weekend.  
2. **Hands-on practice.** After each concept, code an example or mini-project.  
3. **Log your progress.** Keep a daily journal or GitHub issue to reflect on learnings.  
4. **Share & collaborate.** Post questions or findings on Discord/Slack with `#100DaysAI`.  
5. **Cite your sources.** Link tutorials, papers, or videos you use for reference.  
6. **Iterate & revisit.** If a concept wasnâ€™t clear, tag it for a deeper review later.  
7. **Respect licensing.** Use open-source code responsibly and attribute where required.  
8. **Have fun!** Mix in creative experimentsâ€”this is your journey.
