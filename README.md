## Roadmap 🛣️ Overview

This roadmap breaks down 100 days of learning into eight progressive phases:

- **Phases** group related topics together.
- **Daily entries** include mission, why it matters, toolbox, further reading, and challenges.
- You can **fork or copy** each day’s section into individual README files as you see fit.
- Feel free to **adjust pacing**—complete multiple days in one sitting or spread them out.

## Rules 📏 & Guidelines 🦮

1. **Consistency over intensity.** Better to learn 1 hour/day for 100 days than cram in one weekend.  
2. **Hands-on practice.** After each concept, code an example or mini-project.  
3. **Log ✍️ your progress.** Keep a daily journal or GitHub issue to reflect on learnings.  
4. **Share 🛜 & collaborate 🤼.** Post questions or findings on Discord/Slack with `#100DaysAI`.  
5. **Cite your sources.** Link tutorials, papers, or videos you use for reference.  
6. **Iterate 🔁🌀 & revisit.** If a concept wasn’t clear, tag it for a deeper review later.  
7. **Respect licensing 🫡.** Use open-source code responsibly and attribute where required.  
8. **Have fun!** Mix in creative experiments — this is your journey.
