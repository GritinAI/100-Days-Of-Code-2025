### Generative AI 🫧🤖

Previously, we have seen that intelligence can be discriminative or generative. We have seen that discriminative intelligence is associated with a sense of judgment, while generative intelligence is associated more with creativity and the imagination. We also know from everyday life that humans can have varying degrees of these forms of intelligence. For instance, we know that children tend to have very active imaginations (i.e., high generative intelligence), but not very well-developed sense of judgment (i.e., low discriminative intelligence).

Thankfully, AI does not suffer from this particular issue. With AI, we can get the both of both worlds 😀!

### Generative AI 🫧🤖 as Proof of Intelligence

There are those who believe that generative AI 🫧🤖 is the true intelligence. According to this school of thought, anybody could memorize a checklist for discriminative decisions, but it takes a special kind of intelligence to essentially create something from nothing. This school of thought does have some weight to it, seeing as the field of AI had existed for decades now, but it only became noticeably mainstream more recently due to a resurgence in the creative capabilities of generative AI 🫧🤖 in the form of tools like ChatGPT (from OpenAI), Claude (from Anthropic) and Gemini (from Google).

To buttress this point even further, from a religious point of view, one might argue that **God** is a being who possesses the ultimate generative intelligence 🫧🧠, seeing that He created the complex world in a matter of days 🤯!

Some people have more generative intelligence 🫧🧠 than others, but all humans have it to some degree. Still, irrespective of where we fall on the creativity spectrum, two heads 👧👦 are almost always better than one 👧, and we now have generative AI here to help us out 😀!

---

**Fun fact**: The way we tell people they have high generative intelligence 🫧🧠 is by saying something like:

$$ \text{"You are really creative 🫧🧠 😀!"} $$

### Working with Generative AI 🫧🤖

Now that we know we can create new things with generative AI, how do we actually do that🤔? Say I'd like AI to create a new story for me. How do I go about it🤔?

The answer is deceptively simple; we do it the same way we would tell an author to write a new book for us: **We tell them** 😀!

---

$$ \text{Question 🤔: How do we get an AI to create something for us?} $$
$$ \text{Answer 😀💡: We tell it!} $$

### Summary 📝

Having access to generative AI 🫧🤖 is like having access to our very own personal content creator 🤯! We want AI to create a new story? Tell it! We want AI to create a new image? Tell it. Whatever it is we want, just **tell it** 😃!

This sounds like a very simple idea (and it is), but it underlies the myriad ways in which we can use AI today. It lies at the heart of how we can interact with AI 🤖. Most importantly, it touches on the most intuitive way humans communicate with others, and with ourselves: through **language** 🔤.

Much more on this in a future lesson.
