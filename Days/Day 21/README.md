## Artificial intelligence (AI) 🤖

Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as **AI**, is an attempt to emulate human intelligence in machines 🤖. This field intersects with various disciplines, including computer science 💻🧪, neuroscience 🧠, and philosophy 🏛️🥻.

## The Axes of AI 🤖

One could say that AI is an attempt to emulate human intelligence. But I think Peter Norvig might explain AI best. According to Peter Norvig, when we think of AI, we tend to think of it along multiple axes: thinking vs. acting, and human vs. rational.

### Thought vs. Action

On one hand, we believe that for any artificial intelligence to be  considered true, it must be capable of thought 🤔💭. On the other hand, actions are the way in which thoughts 💭 are expressed, either via physical world 🌎 manipulation, or by speech 💬🗣️.

In summary:

- **Thought** involves internal events and/or processes like reasoning and problem-solving.
- **Action** refers to external events and/or processes, such as speech or physical movements.

### Humanity vs. Rationality

I have only just stated that AI is an attempt to emulate human intelligence. However, an AI which emulates human intelligence perfectly may be purely rational, which humans are not; in addition to our intellectual intelligence, we also possess emotional intelligence.

This begs a question: do we prioritize our intelligence or our emotional capacity when building artificial intelligence?

In summary:

- Human-centered AI aims to mimic human behavior.
- Rational AI focuses on optimal, logical decision-making, regardless of human emotional factors.

## The AI Schools 🏫 of Thought

Prior to now, we have discussed different axes along which we can study artificial intelligence. If we intersect these axes, we end up with 4️⃣ different categories i.e., schools of thought we could fall in:

- 1️⃣ Thought 🤔 + Humanity    🧑 (i.e., thinking humanly)
- 2️⃣ Action  💪 + Humanity    🧑 (i.e., acting humanly)
- 3️⃣ Thought 🤔 + Rationality 🧠 (i.e., thinking rationally)
- 4️⃣ Action  💪 + Rationality 🧠 (i.e., acting rationally)

Each of these categories have been explored and researched by notable figures in human history, and we will explore these subcategories one after the other.

### 1️⃣ Thought 🤔 + Humanity 🧑

Here, the idea is very simple:

---

$$ \text{A machine is said to be truly artificially intelligent when it can think in the same way a human can.}\R$$

---

How do we know a machine can think like a human? First, we need to know how humans think!

Getting this knowledge necessitates experiments, and the field of endeavour associated with this study is known as *cognitive science*. Of course, even though we have made amazing progress in studying the human mind, there is still a lot we do not know. As such, building intelligence via this paradigm is a very slow process, and present-day AI has had to (mostly) decouple itself from this school of thought.

---

### 2️⃣ Action 💪 + Humanity 🧑

Here, the idea is also quite simple:

---

$$ \text{A machine is said to be truly artificially intelligent when it can act indistinguishably from a human.}$$

---

Note that this statement does not account for how the machine ***THINKS***, only how it ***ACTS***. In other words, even though the machine does not think as a human, we can still consider it to be truly intelligent, as long as:

1. It can pretend or act like one, and
2. Other humans cannot tell the difference.

This approach of considering intelligence was popularized by a lot of scientists, but notably Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing Test in 1950. This was a test designed to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence. A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.

---

### 3️⃣ Thought 🤔 + Rationality 🧠

The Greek philosopher, Aristotle, was the first to attempt designing a system of determination of right thinking. This gave birth to what we know today to be logic.

Here, the idea is just as simple:

---

$$ \text{Can we build a machine that can figure out the ideal, optimal solutions to problems it is presented with?}$$

---

The idea is to build machines that can encode and leverage the laws of logic, while applying them to solve real-world problems.

---

### 4️⃣ Action 💪 + Rationality 🧠

It is one thing to think rationally; it is another to act as such.

Note that although rational thinking and acting build upon one another, it is still not a necessity that rational thought will be succeeded by rational action. This may be due to failures at the stage of rational thought; sometimes, there is no right, rational choice to make, and some decision must still be made. In other cases, there is just not enough information available to make the a rational decision.

In yet other cases, rational action does not necessarily require any form of thought at all; for instance, recoiling from a hot stove is the rational choice to make, but we do not require any rational thinking to make that choice, since it is a reflex action. In cases such as this, rational actions are still expected, even though there is a failure of either logic or information.

The goal of this school of thought is to build computer programs which can act on the real world as **rational agents** to achieve the best outcome. In the event of uncertainty, the best expected outcome is a fine alternative.

---

In summary:

Intersecting the two AI axes yields four schools of thought:

- **Thought 🤔 + Humanity 🧑**: Machines that think like humans.
- **Action 💪 + Humanity 🧑**: Machines that act indistinguishably from humans.
- **Thought 🤔 + Rationality 🧠**: Machines that solve problems logically to arrive at correct conclusions and inferences.
- **Action 💪 + Rationality 🧠**: Machines that make logical, rational decisions and take actions in the real world.

## Categorizing AI 🤖

Millennia ago, when Aristotle and the Greek philosophers picked an interest in the part of natural philosophy that would become biology, one of the things they did was try to organize and categorize all living things. Centuries later, this work was completed by Carolus Linneaus, and as such we have the classification of the animal kingdom, consisting of Phylum, and the rest. This was a major step, as it helped scientists understand organisms and the relations between them much better.

This idea popularized by Aristotle and Linneaus has so much merit that it crops up in almost all areas  of study. Just like any field of study, segmentation and categorization of the field of artificial intelligence can serve us well and help us understand better.

We could break down the field of AI into different categories based on a number of criteria. They include the:

1️⃣ type of intelligence,
2️⃣ breadth of this intelligence,
3️⃣ type of methods used to build this intelligence, and
4️⃣ type of information to be processed with this intelligence.

---

### 1️⃣ AI Types

Human intelligence is of great importance to us. Indeed, it is so important that our species is literally named for it: *Homo sapiens*, to mean, *thinking man*, *intelligent man*.

Over the years, humans have evolved to leverage intelligence for different tasks in different spheres of life. From differentiating between edible and poisonous mushrooms, to questioning the existence of the stars and the possibility of space aliens, human intelligence has featured prominently in our greatest achievements.

Analyzing these achievements, as well as the ways in which we have evolved to use intelligence, we can segregate intelligence into two main categories: **discriminative intelligence**, and **generative intelligence**.

Discriminative intelligence allows us to compare and contrast different objects, ideas, locations and much more. This kind of intelligence came into play as our earliest ancestors learnt to tell edible 😋 from poisonous ☠️ mushrooms 🍄. When we decide on whether a business deal is favorable or not, or when the doctor decides if our symptoms are a sign of diabetes or not, this is the type of intelligence in play. This form of intelligence usually shows itself in form of a sense of judgement or discernment.

By contrast, generative intelligence is the form of intelligence we colloquially refer to as **creativity**. Creative people are usually high in this form of intelligence, and this is the form of intelligence responsible for achievements like poetry, essay writing, paintings, art & sculpture, and so on.

In summary, when we need to compare 🍎🍊 or weigh ⚖️ the value of objects or ideas, we need discriminative intelligence. When we need to create new ideas or objects, we need generative intelligence. Generative intelligence allows us create a new book; discriminative intelligence lets us know whether we wrote a good story or a bad one😀!

---

#### Discriminative vs. generative AI

Artificial intelligence is in many ways an attempt to recreate human intelligence. As such, not only does it make sense that there are also discriminative and generative AIs, it makes sense that they serve similar purposes as their human analogs.

Discriminative AI has been around for quite a long time. However, it is generative AI that is responsible for the current boom in AI popularity and usage. As such, going forward, more emphasis wil be placed on it.

1. **Discriminative Intelligence**:
   - Focuses on comparing, contrasting, and making judgments.
   - Examples: Medical diagnosis, financial analysis.

2. **Generative Intelligence**:
   - Involves creativity and innovation.
   - Examples: Art creation, writing.

---

### 2️⃣ AI Breadth

As stated prior, intelligence levels vary between and even within human populations. A quick Google search on intelligence quotient (IQ) will quickly put any doubts to rest.

IQ scores already give us the ability to quantify human levels of intelligence. However, there are some shortcomings with it, on of which includes the difficulty in observing people at the lower and upper ends of the scale. Still, IQ scores are useful enough. And so the natural question:

---

$$\text{Can we apply some form of IQ testing to AI🤔?}$$

---

The natural answer is: "Yes". We just need to build an intelligent system and administer an IQ test. However, it is only relatively recently that we became capable of AI systems intelligent enough to take IQ tests. As such, for the longest period of time, AI researchers looked at AI intelligence levels as a qualification with two categories which have attendant schools of thought: **strong AI** and **weak AI**.

#### Strong AI

This is the school of thought which believes that by giving a computer program sufficient processing power, and by providing it with enough intelligence, one can create a computer that can literally think and is conscious in the same way that a human is conscious.

When we speak of AI, this is usually what we mean; an intelligent system that can understand and process information like humans because it can literally think, feel and experience consciousness like any human being!

However, many scientists and AI researchers believe this is a pipe dream. In fact, AI such as this has recently obtained a new name: **Seemingly Conscious AI ([SCAI](https://mustafa-suleyman.ai/seemingly-conscious-ai-is-coming))**. This is because recent AI systems have got so good at seeming to be conscious, even though they are actually not so.

#### Weak AI

This school simply focuses on modelling intelligent behavior and using these modelled behavior to develop computers that can solve problems. Note that this school of thought is concerned with machine behavior, not thinking. This implies that proponents of this idea would align closely with the [**Action + Humanity**](#action--humanity) category of AI.

This point of view argues that a computer behaving intelligently does not prove that it is actually intelligent in the way that a human is. Even a broken clock tells the correct time twice a day, and a parrot can always tell the correct time if you teach it well enough. This does not mean the clock works well or that the parrot is intelligent enough to really understands the reading of time.

### 3️⃣ AI Design Methods

Analogous to the divide between strong and weak AI, we have strong and weak methods of actually building AI.

#### Strong Methods

These are methods that depend on building AI by leveraging huge amounts of information about the world and the problems that it might encounter in it.

#### Weak Methods

These methods are used to build AI systems that depend on tools such as logic, automated reasoning, and other general structures that can be applied to a wide range of problems but that do not necessarily incorporate any real knowledge about the world of the problem that is being solved.

#### Contrasting Strong and Weak AI Methods

|Factor                |  Weak Methods           | Strong Methods                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Real-world knowledge  | Limited; little to none.| A lot.                          |
|Dependency            | Generalized.            | Depends on weak methods.        |
|Present popularity    | Low.                    | Very high!                      |
|Examples              | Expert systems.         | Machine learning, deep learning.|

### 4️⃣ Information Types

Studies of the human brain show that specific areas of the brain are used for specific actions ranging from talking and reading to singing and swimming to watching a movie or listening to a song.

Having different substructures of the brain for processing different types of information implies that these substructures possess certain properties that allow the to display certain flavours of intelligence useful for certain tasks. For instance, the part of the brain that processes images is different from the part that comes up with ideas in the shower 😳!

This fact is the bedrock for the different subfields of AI that have sprung up over the years. They include but are not limited to:

- **Natural language processing** (AI for processing text 🔡 and audio 🔉),
- **Computer vision** (AI for image 🖼️ and video 📺 analysis)
- **Geometric learning** (AI for processing graphs ⛓️‍💥⛓️ and spatial 🗺️ data)

## When Best to Use AI?

So, why do we need AI? What can it do for us? There are three main hallmarks that tell us AI can be useful for our tasks.

1. *Monotony* 🥱💤😩: Certain jobs are repetitive, for instance, marking student scripts, or checking resumes for job applicants. Jobs like this become routine, boring, and humans run the risk of getting tired and complacent when performing them. Machine, and AI by extension, on the other hand, do not have this limitation.
2. *Complex Decision-Making*: Some tasks are a black-box i.e., we cannot explain how we perform them. Computers 💻 work based on algorithms. An algorithm is a step-by-step description of the solution to a problem. Therefore, for  computers to solve a problem, a human must have already come up with the step-by-step solution first. For instance, when building a website, humans already know how the end product would look, and then they write specific code instructions in code for the computer to execute.

    There are some jobs however, whose solution humans cannot describe to the computer. In these instances, it makes sense to get a computer and feed it the data it needs to figure out the right answer. This is where AI comes in handy.
3. *Standard Rules* 🧑‍⚖️👨‍⚖️: Some jobs have a stable set of rules that underlay them. For instance, when judging a customer for a financial 💵💶 loan at the bank 🏦, the procedure is mostly the same. The bank teller considers the same factors, irrespective of the customer being considered. However, with just one teller attending to multiple loan applicants, the job quickly becomes tedious. AI can be used to scale up the number of applicants the teller can attend to.

## Summary 📝

- AI is an attempt to emulate human intelligence.
- Different people approach AI with different goals in mind. Are you concerned with thinking or behavior? Do you want to model humans or work from an ideal (i.e., rational) standard?
- AI can be discriminative (i.e., intelligence for making decisions and judgments) or generative (i.e., intelligence for creating things).
- Believers in strong AI argue that a computer that displays intelligent behavior must be capable of possessing mental states and, therefore, of being truly conscious and intelligent in the same way that humans are.
- Believers in weak AI argue that computers can be programmed to mimic intelligent behavior in order to solve specific problems. This does ot, however, make them strictly intelligent.
- Weak methods are those that do not rely on any knowledge or understanding of the world and the problems being solved.
- Strong methods require knowledge about the world and about the problem being solved. This approach is more scalable, and essential for solving many complex real world problems using AI.
- AI is particularly useful for monotonous/repetitive 🥱💤😩, complex 🤯, or rule-based ⚖️ tasks.
